Q. 2 A) Write a Python NumPy program to compute the weighted average along the specified axis of a given flattened array. 


import numpy as np



# Create a flattened array

data = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])



# Create weights for the array

weights = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])



# Compute the weighted average

weighted_average = np.average(data, weights=weights)



# Display the result

print(f"Flattened Array: {data}")

print(f"Weights: {weights}")

print(f"Weighted Average: {weighted_average}")




Q. 2 B) Write a Python program to view basic statistical details of the data (Use advertising.csv) 


import pandas as pd



# Load the advertising dataset

df = pd.read_csv('advertising.csv')  # Replace with your actual file path



# Display basic statistical details of the data

basic_stats = df.describe()



# Print the statistics

print("Basic Statistical Details:")

print(basic_stats)
