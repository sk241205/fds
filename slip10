Q.2 A) Write a python program to Display column-wise mean, and median for the SOCRHeightWeight dataset.


import pandas as pd



# Load the SOCRHeightWeight dataset

df = pd.read_csv('SOCRHeightWeight.csv')  # Replace with the actual file path



# Calculate column-wise mean

mean_values = df.mean()



# Calculate column-wise median

median_values = df.median()



# Display the results

print("Column-wise Mean:")

print(mean_values)



print("\nColumn-wise Median:")

print(median_values)




Q.2 B) Write a python program to compute sum of Manhattan distance between all pairs of points. 


import numpy as np



# Sample data points (you can modify these points or read from a file)

points = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 5], [4, 1], [8, 0]])



def manhattan_distance(point1, point2):

    return np.abs(point1[0] - point2[0]) + np.abs(point1[1] - point2[1])



def total_manhattan_distance(points):

    total_distance = 0

    num_points = len(points)

   

    for i in range(num_points):

        for j in range(i + 1, num_points):  

            total_distance += manhattan_distance(points[i], points[j])

   

    return total_distance




result = total_manhattan_distance(points)


print(f"Sum of Manhattan distances between all pairs of points: {result}")
